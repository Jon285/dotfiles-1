## Installation Note
Read before you try to execute <a href="https://github.com/aesophor/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/dotsetup">dotsetup</a> to setup the dotfiles. The script will ask the user for username (should be the same with the name of your home directory), attempt to remove old directories or files (if exist), and create symlink to ~/.config/dotfiles/blah...
